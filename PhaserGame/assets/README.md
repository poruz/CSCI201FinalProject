Instructions for level design -

File naming convention: Level0x.json (x is from 0 to 9 inclusive).
Level00.json has already been created. Please copy it and edit that for other levels.
Each block is 40x40 and so is the ball.
The game screen is 800x600.
Therefore, in each row there can be max 20 blocks.
There are 15 rows in total.
A, B, C, D, E and F represent BlockA through BlockF.
P represents Ball Start Position.
Q represents Ball Finish Position.
***Make sure to leave first row as ......... because we are displaying time in that row.
